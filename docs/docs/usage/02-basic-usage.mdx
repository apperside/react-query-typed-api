import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

# Basic Usage
This library is a wrapper around react-query, so before you begin using this library, you need to install and configure react-query as explained in [their docs](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview).

react-query-typed-api is also heavily based on the concept of augmentation, you can find more about typescript augmentation in [the dedicated documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation). 

The first interface to know about is AppRoutes, which is declared as follows
```typescript
    export interface AppRoutes {
      main: MainApi
    }
    
    export interface MainApi {
      /**
       * TO BE AUGMENTED
       */
    }
```
The statement `main: MainApi` means that the app has one default api, whose scope is `main`. You can create as many scopes you want, we will speak about api scopes [later on](#api-scopes) .

In order to agument the main scope and add your routes, you have to augment `MainApi` interface
```typescript
    /**
     * You have to add this declaration wherever you want to augment librariy's types
     */
    declare module "react-query-typed-api" {
      /**
       * Augment this interface to add al custom endpoints
       */
      export interface MainApi {
        // MyApiResponseType and MyApiPayloadType are whatever type you want depending on your endpoint response and payload
        "my-route": { responseType: MyApiResponseType, payloadType: MyApiPayloadType }
        // if the payload is the same as the response, you can omit the payloadType 
        "another-custom-route": { responseType: MyApiResponseType2 }
      }
    }
```
let say  we augment our main api like this 

```typescript
    type MyApiResponseType = { responseField1: string }
    type MyApiPayloadType = { payloadField1: string }
    type MyApiResponseType2 = { responseField2: string }
    
    declare module "react-query-typed-api" {
      export interface MainApi {
        "my-route": { responseType: MyApiResponseType, payloadType: MyApiPayloadType }
        "another-custom-route": { responseType: MyApiResponseType2 }
      }
    }
```
We are defining 2 routes:
**my-route**: it will return data of type `MyApiResponseType`, and it will accept data of type `MyApiPayloadType`  when using mutation.
**another-custom-route**: it will return data of type `MyApiResponseType`, and it will accept data of type `MyApiPayloadType`  when using mutation.

With such configuration you will have the following typescript behavior

<ReactPlayer loop playing controls loop url='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5955338/169349796-9faac282-770b-427d-8508-997ea08217aa.mp4' />



> **IMPORTANT**: every entry under `MainApi` must have these fields:
> 
> `responseType`
> **mandatory**, it represents the type of the response and the type of the payload if `payloadType` is not defined
> 
> `payloadType`
> **optional**, it represents the type of the payload for mutations, `responseType` will be used if not provided
> 
> `mutationResponseType`
> **optional**, it represents the response type for mutations, `responseType` will be used if not provided
> 


`useAppQuery` is nothing else that a wrapper around react-query's `useQuery`, it just wraps it with strong typing thanks to typescript augmentation. Together with `useAppQuery` there is also `useAppMutation`


As your can see, types are automatically inferred based on the types declared through augmentation

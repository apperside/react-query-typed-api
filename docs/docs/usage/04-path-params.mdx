# Path variables
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

You can also use routes with variable parameters. Given we augment the api like this
```typescript
      type MyApiResponseType = { field1: string }
      type MyApiPayloadType = { field2: string }
      
      export interface MainApi {
            "my-route/:id": { responseType: MyApiResponseType, payloadType: MyApiPayloadType },
      }
```
we can use this endpoint like this:

**QUERY**
```typescript
    const query = useAppQuery("my-route/:id", { pathParams: { id: "123" } });
```
**MUTATION**
```typescript
    const mutation = useAppMutation("my-route/:id")
    // the _ before pathParams is not a typo, read below for more info
    mutation.mutate({ field2: "value", _pathParams: { id: "123" } })
```
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Type inferring does not work for path params, and probably it never will üòÉ

> **A note about `mutate` and `mutateAsync` methods:** In react-query, when you call `mutate` or `mutateAsync`, you can just pass the payload
> for the request and an options object where you can pass just some
> callbacks. To allow the best possible integration for path params, we
> added `_pathParams` as a valid field to pass to `mutate` and
> `mutateAsync`, because sometimes it may be tricky to have the values
> to use as path variables at the moment you call useMutation (imagine
> for example a form submission, you most probably will have the value
> you need only when the form is submitted).
> 
> Since this field will never be passed to the request payload, we
> prefixed it with underscore to allow you to pass a `pathParams` field
> (without underscore) to you payload in case you may need. If you will
> need to pass a _pathParams field to your payload, **it will not work**

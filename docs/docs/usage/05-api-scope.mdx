# API Scopes
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

You can use augmentation to add as many set of apis as you need, you just need to augment the interface `AppRoutes`. An api scope is intended to be a group of endpoint pointing to the same server and having the same prefix. Let say you augment it in the following way
```typescript
      type MyApiResponseType = { responseField1: string }
      type MyApiPayloadType = { payloadField1: string }
      type MyApiResponseType2 = { responseField2: string }
    
      export interface MainApi {
        "my-route/:id": { responseType: MyApiResponseType, payloadType: MyApiPayloadType },
      }
    
      /**
       * Augment this interface to as many groups of api you need.
       * A group of api is a set of endpoints that share the same prefix,server,port and protocol
       */
      export interface AppRoutes {
        
        anotherApi: {
          "another-api-route": { responseType: { anotherApiResponseField: string } }
        }
      }
```
You will be able to use the other scopes like this 
```typescript
      const query = useAppQuery({ scope: "anotherApi", route: "another-api-route" });
    
      const mutation = useAppMutation({ scope: "anotherApi", route: "another-api-route" })
```
You will have full intellisense also in this case

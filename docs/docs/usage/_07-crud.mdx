# CRUD ENDPOINTS

CRUD is an acronim for Create,Read,Update,Delete, which are the four major functions used to interact with data resources.
This library comes with some utility type to help you consuming RESTFul endpoints for CRUD operations very conventienly.
CRUD apis are all about conventions, and are usually implemented by following some patterns involving the endpoints structure and the [HTTP Verb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) used to interact with the endpoint.

Given a resource (which can be a blog post, an ecommerce order, a user or anything), a RESTFul api for CRUD operations should at least allow us to:

- get all resources of a given type
- get one resource by its id
- create a new item
- update an item
- delete one item

Given for example a resource named `order`, and being `http://myawesomeserver.com/api/` the base api url, these operations can be defined by the following sample endpoints<br />

| HTTP VERB              | ENDPOINT                                  | DESCRIPTION                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **GET**                | http://myawesomeserver.com/api/orders     | get all orders                     |
| **GET**                | http://myawesomeserver.com/api/orders/:id | get one orer by id                 |
| **POST**               | http://myawesomeserver.com/api/orders     | create a new order                 |
| **PUT**( or **PATCH**) | http://myawesomeserver.com/api/orders/:id | update the order with the given id |
| **DELETE**             | http://myawesomeserver.com/api/orders/:id | delete the order with the given id |

And so on for each resource you have to deal with. <br/><br/>
In addition to defining a pattern on how to interact with the resources, we also need to define a standard for the responses.<br/>
Once we have a predictable way to query the resources, and we have a predictable response structure, typescript gives us a lot of room to abstract this concepts.

Let define for example a very simple User object like this:

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  email: string;
  name: string;
};
```

We could define the following responses:

GET ALL
Being `Order` the type that defines an hipotetical order object of Let say that the responses of our endpoints will have the be the following:
You can use the following methods:

- httpGet
- httpPost
- httpPut
- httpPatch
- httpDelete

The parameters you can pass to them are the same you can pass to useAppQuery
